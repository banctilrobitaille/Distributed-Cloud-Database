> This cloud database project has been developped as part of the Cloud Database Praktikum (IN4163) at TUM (Technische Universität München). The team had to implement a distributed, scalable, encrypted, replicated database within a 16 weeks timespan and defend its design choices. The proposed solution includes an external configuration manager, SSL communication, a load balancer, custom transactions and StatsD metric. The team received an <strong>sehr gut</strong> grade for this project which is the highest possible.
